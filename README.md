# kapsi-git-manager
Simple script (and later perhaps an app) for configuring and handling git repostitories in kapsi.fi.
This is not meant to be general purpose or to work elsewhere, just to help those others who are using the same combination.

# Installing
virtualenv + requirements.txt + install this package there with setyp.py install.
then make configurations from the example_confs into your public_html/mysite folder and there change all text written in CAPS of mysite.fcgi into something else.
